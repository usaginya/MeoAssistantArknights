## Frequently Asked Questions

### The program crashes immediately when I try to run it

- Possible solution 1: you are missing some runtime libraries.
  Please try installing [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-160#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022), [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) and restart the program.
- Possible solution 2: your CPU instruction set is incompatible.
  This project requires `PaddleOCR` to do the image recognition, which requires `AVX` instruction set that is supported by only some of the newly-released CPUs, while others may not support it.
  You can also try downloading `PaddleOCR` [NoAVX](../3rdparty/ppocr_noavx.zip) version, unzip and replace the files with the same names. Since it may cause performance drop, please do not use it unless it is necessary.  
  ([CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) is a tool that provides check of existence of `AVX` instruction set.)  
- If those solutions above do not work, please submit an issue to us.

### Connection error/not knowing how to fill in ADB path

Tips: please refer to the [Usage](../README-en.md#Usage) section to ensure that you are using your simulator correctly.

- Approach 1: find the installation path of your simulator, where there may be a file named `adb.exe` (or something similar, e.g. `nox_adb.exe`, `HD-adb.exe`, `adb_server.exe`, etc., EXE files with `adb`). Simply choose the file in the connection settings of MAA!
- Approach 2: please refer to the [Custom Connection](#custom-connection) section.
- Approach 3: change another simulator, such as [Bluestacks international version](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) Nougat 64 bit
- Approach 4: change the code related. You can find the code [here](../src/MeoAsstGui/Helper/WinAdapter.cs) written in C# which is related to the hook on the simulator process and getting ADB path. Feel free to submit PR to us!

### Wrong Recognition/Program freezes after starting

Tip 1: The `Current Stage` of auto battle that costs Sanity requires you to go to the screen with the start button. Please confirm they are not related.
Tip 2: Follow the steps below until the problem is solved.

1. Confirm that your simulator is supported in the [List of the Supported Simulators](List of the Supported Simulators.md).
2. Change the DPI to `320 dpi`.
3. Change the resolution to landscape, `1280 * 720`.
4. Try with another simulator, such as [Bluestacks international version](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) Nougat 64 bit. (Please note that you are required to switch on ADB in Bluestack simulator.)
5. Submit an issue to us if the problem still exists.

### Custom Connection

- Download [adb](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) and unzip it.
- Go to `Settings` - `Connection Settings`, and select the location of `adb.exe`, fill in the address of ADB (with the format of IP+port, e.g. `127.0.0.1:5555`), and choose the type of your simulator.

### ADB already exists in the environment variable. Do I stil need to download it?

You need not do so! Go to `Settings` - `Connection Settings`, and set  `ADB path` to `adb.exe`, or other relative path.
